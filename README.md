# OVGU_DSRS
Data science with R seminar project
the README.md file must give an overview of what you are handing in: your project notebook, data, and URLs to your project websites and screencast videos.
In this repository following files are provided:
- Project R-markdown along with data image file to make it easier to re-run the R-markdown file or the R code by itself.
- dataset : at the begining we loaded the raw datasets into MS SQL server since the amount of data was huge. Afterwards we performed variety of pre-processing steps.
